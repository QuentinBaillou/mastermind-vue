## Rules of the game

This project is a classic mastermind game. In 12 round, you have to find a random combination of five colors, based on the indication given by the computer. It can tell you if a color is well-placed, or if a color is present, but misplaced. Obviously, it doesn't say which color is well-placed or not. You have to discover it by yourself !

## The project

This project is a game made with the framework VueJS, thanks to Vue CLI. It is my first real project with this framework, but the transition between React and Vue was smooth, because a lot of concept are shared by those two.
